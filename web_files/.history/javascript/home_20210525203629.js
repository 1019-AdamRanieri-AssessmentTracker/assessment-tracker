/*
    This is the "home.html" page specific js/JQuery override file
    Use this to write custom js/JQuery code that will be accessible to "home.html" only

    -------------------Standards and Best Practices---------
    -- 1. Make sure to always copy and paste this header to each *.js file to map the important functionality
    -- 2. Use the page specific code sparingly, do your best to write relative Dynamic code - will save time and energy
    -- 3. When reaching Production please "minify" all
