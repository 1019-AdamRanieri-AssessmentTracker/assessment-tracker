# Assessment Tracker Application

## Project Description

The Assessment Tracker is an application designed to help track an individual's progress through a batch training. A user can see all the batches organized by year, view a particular week for a batch, create new assessments, and organize assessments into types. Each assessment is assigned a weight to contribute to the final grade, and associates that complete a given assignment are given a grade in the application.
