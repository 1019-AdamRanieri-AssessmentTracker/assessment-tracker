# Assessment Tracker Application

## Project Description

The Assessment Tracker is an application designed to help track an individual's progress through a batch training. A user can see all the batches organized by year, view a particular week for a batch, create new assessments, update grades for associates for each assessment, and leave notes for associates as needed. In addition, the application calculates the average grade for each assessment, as well as the average grade per week according to weights assigned to each assessment.
